This repo describes the methodology developed in Agrawal & McCloskey 2024 for the calculation of earthquake ground motion intensities using simulation-based estimates of crustal seismic response.
* Jupyter notebook `PGA_calc_vs_sim.ipynb` contains a step-by-step demonstration of the method.
* The `Data` folder contains the necessary files used for the demonstration.
